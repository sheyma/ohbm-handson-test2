hbm 2021 handson session testing

Abstract

Almost all researchers have data and analysis scripts that generate results in the form of figures. Yet, few other researchers can use these exact data and scripts to generate the same figures, or to reproduce all results of the study. In this session, we’ll take you on a journey of building reproducible workflows that help alleviate the anxiety associated with receiving that dreaded email 'I’d like to reproduce your results...'

We’ll start with helping others run your code on their machines, and end up with a fully reproducible workflow

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
$ python3 code/analyis_01.py

```
